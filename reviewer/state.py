"""Persistent state, in SQLite, under ``~/.local/state/blinky/``.

Deliberately outside the checkout: it holds PR titles and, under ``--debug``,
diff content. Keeping it out of the repo means a stale ``.gitignore`` cannot turn
into a leak.

State is what makes this cheap. A PR whose head SHA has not moved and which has
no new comments is skipped before any diff is fetched and long before the model
is called.
