"""Prompt assembly.

The system prompt is your ``personality/`` files concatenated in the order the
repo config lists them, with the output contract always appended last, plus the
language instruction.

The repository's own agent docs (``AGENTS.md``, ``CLAUDE.md``, whatever
``repo_context.paths`` matches) are read from the **default branch** and
injected inside ``<repo_context>`` as reference material. Reading it from the PR
branch would let a pull request ship instructions to the reviewer that is about
to decide whether to approve it. That is a short path from "opens a PR" to
"gets an approval". A PR that modifies those files is surfaced as a finding
instead.
