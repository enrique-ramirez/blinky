"""Calling the model.

The model is invoked as a pure function: text in, JSON out. It gets read-only
access to a clean checkout of the PR head so it can look at surrounding code,
and nothing else: no shell it can write with, no network, and no GitHub token
anywhere in its environment.

Its working directory is a neutral empty scratch dir rather than the checkout.
That matters: every one of these CLIs auto-loads instructions from the directory
it starts in (``CLAUDE.md``, ``AGENTS.md``, ``GEMINI.md``), so running one
inside the PR's tree would let a pull request feed instructions to its own
reviewer. Repo context is read from the default branch and injected as delimited
data instead (see ``prompt.py``).

Which CLI actually runs is a config question, answered in ``providers.py``.
Everything in this module is true whichever one it is: one process, one prompt
on stdin, one JSON object back, and a handle held so the call can be stopped
when the tool quits.
